I built this website with React, Typescript and Sass. Unsurprisingly, I did
not design the website, and the sleek space design was by
[@mispelledname](https://github.com/mispelledname).

The website is hosted on Firebase, and the domain registration and DNS
services are from Namecheap. This time, deploying to a subdomain was
surprisingly straightforward, maybe I'll write about it sometime.

The scroll component on the bottom left was a really tricky bit, and currently
it's not perfect, but it works most of the time...

Screenshots and more details coming soon!
