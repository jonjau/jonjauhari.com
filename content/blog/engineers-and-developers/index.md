Once, I heard that there was a 'financial engineering' subject taught at
my university.

Surely, I can't be the only one that thinks that sounds nefarious/malicious.

In fact, I had been taking an introductory finance class at that time, and
one of the lessons

Shouldn't finance be straightforward? complexity hides fraudulence...

Coming back to that moment a few times, I've realised that softeng

I've always found it odd that 'Software Engineer' is a legitimate term.

I always thought it sounded too 'good'

never found it fitting for what I've seen

do not deal with physical systems, does not fit common definitions of 
engineering

Another little bit of term-hijacking that we could do without.

Part of a trend of appropriating terms originally for physical objects to
describe software products or digital concepts, prefix e in front of
everything, but we grew out of that quickly, there is no e-cloud, electric or
electronic? digital virtual meta.

We could make up words instead: firewall, metaverse, devops

We see this manifest too in the way programming is taught. The allure of
teaching inheritance with animals, dogs and cats...

The similarities and differences between classical engineering and this
wannabe discipline.

the main constraint is communication, instead of physical limitations

That malleability of software makes it much easier to overengineer. By nature,
software is built upon layers and layers of abstraction, The "tools" we
"invent" are not to conquer gravitational limitations, but simply to conquer
our aversity to complex information systems.

On the same token, it is equally easy to oversimplify: the fewer levers to
fiddle with, the harder it is to get a handle (literally) on what's going on.
An immediate example would be list comprehensions in Python hiding
computational complexity, and being harder to debug.

I think it doesn't help that
The lower barrier of entry coupled with the half-false "prestige" that
the title of "engineer", as well as the very-real high salaries the
career path promises, tends to brew overconfidence

A unique concept in software engineering is version control

don't forget hardware.

unlike a bridge, software products can improve without the developers knowing
compilers do a lot of heavy lifting. Bad code on good boxes run OK.

even more term overloading: machine learning and business intelligence.

some words are bubbling up: coding, programming, developing, engineering,
architecting

many roles to play: communicating, designing, developing, refactoring,
deploying, testing
