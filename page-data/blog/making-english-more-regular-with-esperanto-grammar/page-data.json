People just (have to) get used to them. In general:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Grammar is complex (13+ tenses!) and verb modification is irregular.</li>\n<li>Ambiguous semantics: the same sentence can mean different things.</li>\n<li>Spelling does not reflect pronunciation; accents vary wildly.</li>\n<li>Vocabulary is vast and borrows from many other languages.</li>\n<li>Spoken vs written disconnect: slang, idioms, figures of speech.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What can be done to improve it? I’m not sure, but there have been\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_English_(version_of_English)\">been</a>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English\">many</a>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_English_Wikipedia\">efforts</a>, mainly\nby simplifying sentence structure and restricting vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s no changing the way English is spoken in the\nmainstream, but ideas are ideas, so here’s one.</p>\n<p>Designing a new language from the ground up is hard, so in any case\nvocabulary should be kept constant (if not restricted to simpler words). This\nmeans points 3, 4, 5 are off-limits, there is no way to improve on those\nwithout modifying English words or how they are spelled\n(<a href=\"https://jonjau.github.io/projects/cifero/\">related</a>). So, grammar has to\nchange.</p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking about how Esperanto\n<a href=\"https://lernu.net/en/gramatiko\">grammar constructs</a> (the few that I know)\ncan be used to make English and similar languages to be more regular. This\nshould address point 1 and, to a certain extent, point 2 as well. Specifically,\nthis post explores that in the context of ambiguity in sentences, which is\napparently\n<a href=\"https://michealaxelsen.com/blog/?p=346\">an inherent property of all natural languages</a>.</p>\n<h3>Grammar simplification</h3>\n<p>All we’re taking from Esperanto are the suffixes and sentence structure.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Suffix</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-o</td>\n<td align=\"left\">noun</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-a</td>\n<td align=\"left\">adjective</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-e</td>\n<td align=\"left\">adverb</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The immediate problem are the words themselves. Most English words have\nmeaning baked into their “root words”, like ‘often’ or ‘again’; modifying\nthem with suffixes leads to non-obvious interpretations (‘again-o’: what would\n‘again’ mean as a noun?) and should be avoided, but what if someone does it\nanyway? Exceptions regarding special word forms will have to remain.</p>\n<p>A good practice might be to avoid special words and phrases altogether, and\nstick with simple suffix-friendly words, say ‘frequent-e’ to mean\n‘frequently’ instead of ‘often’. I don’t know how ‘again’ could be avoided,\nit might have to be an exception.</p>\n<p>The verb suffix system for Esperanto is\n<a href=\"http://esperanto.davidgsimpson.com/eo-verbforms.html\">well-defined</a>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Suffix</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Meaning</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Example</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Interpretation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-as</td>\n<td align=\"left\">present</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I do-as</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I do</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-is</td>\n<td align=\"left\">past</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I do-is</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I did</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-os</td>\n<td align=\"left\">future</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I do-os</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I will do</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-u</td>\n<td align=\"left\">imperative</td>\n<td align=\"left\">do-u it-n!</td>\n<td align=\"left\">do it!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-us</td>\n<td align=\"left\">conditional</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I do-us</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I would do</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-i</td>\n<td align=\"left\">infinitive</td>\n<td align=\"left\">do-i it</td>\n<td align=\"left\">to do it</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>More complex verb suffixes (maybe unnecessary):</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Suffix</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Meaning</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Example</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Interpretation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-anta</td>\n<td align=\"left\">present active</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I be-as do-anta</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I am doing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-inta</td>\n<td align=\"left\">perfect active</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I be-as do-inta</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I have done</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-onta</td>\n<td align=\"left\">future active</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I be-as do-onta</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I am about to do</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-ata</td>\n<td align=\"left\">present passive</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I be-as do-ata</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I am being done</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-ita</td>\n<td align=\"left\">perfect passive</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I be-as do-ita</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I have been done</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">-ota</td>\n<td align=\"left\">future passive</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I be-as do-ota</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I am about to be done</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Going further</h3>\n<p>But what if we wanted to extend verbs such that they could be nouns,\nadjectives or adverbs?</p>\n<p>Consider <code>'repeat-e'</code>. It means ‘repeat’, as an adverb. But how exactly should\nit be interpreted?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Repetitively</li>\n<li>Repeatedly</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both are adverbs and they overlap in meaning — maybe they should not be\ndifferent words in the first place. But the rule was to not modify English\nwords more than necessary. Trying to get at meaning 1 leads to another issue:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>repetition-e</code></li>\n<li><code>repetitive-e</code></li>\n<li><code>repetitively-e</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Which one is correct? Perhaps all of them, although 3 is redundant. We see\nmixing English suffixes and (abused) Esperanto suffixes leads to even more\nchoice.</p>\n<p>So, abusing Esperanto’s suffix system, words can become verbs, adjectives or\nadverbs, as appropriate. Let’s say prepositions (over, on, at), articles (a,\nthe), conjunctions (and, or) are not changed.</p>\n<p>In this system, the words to\nwhich we attach suffixes are the English words, and those words don’t have to\nbe actual root words. It’s not always possible and might lead to ambiguity\n(e.g. <code>'repeat-e'</code>).</p>\n<p>Here’s how the system might be used to disambiguate some sentences:</p>\n<h3>Syntactic ambiguity</h3>\n<p>Also known as structural ambiguity or grammatical ambiguity. This is when\nthe structure of the sentence makes its meaning unclear.</p>\n<p>A popular example is:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">I saw a man on a hill with a telescope.</code></pre></div>\n<p>There are several interpretations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The hill has a telescope.</li>\n<li>The man has a telescope.</li>\n<li>I used a telescope to see the man.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The sentence might be disambiguated by context, or a change in sentence\nstructure:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. I saw a man on a hill, which had a telescope.\n2. I saw a man, who had a telescope, on a hill.\n3. I saw, using a telescope, a man on a hill.</code></pre></div>\n<p>If it were “I saw a man with a woman with a telescope”, disambiguation\nwould be much more difficult. In speech, emphasis and pauses could be used.</p>\n<p>A possible translation:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. I see-is man-on on have-telescope-a hill-o.\n2. I see-is have-telescope-a man-on on hill-o.\n3. I use-telescope-e see-is man-on on hill-o.</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>the article ‘a’ is dropped.</li>\n<li>-o marks a noun.</li>\n<li>-on marks a noun that is the direct object of the verb\n(here the man is the object of seeing, ‘so man-on’).</li>\n<li>-is turns a verb into past tense.</li>\n<li>-e marks an adverb.</li>\n<li>-a marks an adjective.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But using -e and -a to mark adverbial and adjectival clauses is probably not\na good idea, since they might get more complex. What if instead of ‘have\ntelescope’ we had ‘had one telescope and now have two’? More extensible but\nless natural would be:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. I see-is man-on on hill-o which have-as telescope-on.\n2. I see-is man-on who have-as telescope-on on hill-o.\n3. I see-is use-ante telescope-on man-on on hill-o.</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>-ant- marks continuity, and again, -e makes an adverb so ‘use-ante\ntelescope-on’ is an adverbial clause that would describe an action as ‘using\na telescope’, in this case the action is ‘seeing’.</li>\n<li>-as turns a verb into present tense.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lexical ambiguity 1</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">She went to the bank.</code></pre></div>\n<p>What bank? Merriam-Webster lists\n<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bank\">5 entries</a> for ‘bank’, but\nthe sentence structure rules out the verb definitions. Also, the 5th definition\n(‘a group or series of objects arranged together in a row’) seems quire rare.\nHere ‘bank’ is either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the bank of a river</li>\n<li>the bank to deposit your money in</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Further context is needed, and often it is available. There is no good way to\ndeal with this without adding an extra clause.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. She go-is to the-bank-o of the-river-o.\n2. She go-is to the-bank-o for store-i money-o.</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>-i makes a verb infinitive: ‘store-i money-o’ is ‘to store money’.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lexical ambiguity 2</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">I like understanding people.</code></pre></div>\n<p>This time the sentence structure doesn’t help us, and the ambiguity arises\nfrom the fact that ‘understanding’ can be a verb or an adjective:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I like people who are understanding.</li>\n<li>I like to understand people.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Disambiguation by inventing new English words (this is irregular, and not always\npossible):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. I like understanders.\n2. I like people-understanding.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Esperanto grammar is particularly well-suited for this. Changing the suffix\nchanges the role of the word.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. I like-as understand-ajn person-ojn.\n2. I like-as understand-i person-ojn.</code></pre></div>\n<p>In the first sentence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-j, pronounced like ‘y’, marks plurality: ‘people’ becomes ‘person-oj’, then\nit becomes ‘person-ojn’ because it is the direct object of ‘like’.</li>\n<li>The adjective ‘understand-a’ describes ‘person-ojn’, so the former follows the\nlatter’s suffixes: ‘understand-ajn’.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the second sentence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-i marks an infinitive: ‘understand-i’ is ‘to understand’.</li>\n<li>‘understand-i person-ojn’ means ‘people-understanding’ as a noun, it is the\ndirect object of ‘like’, so there is an -n.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Morphological ambiguity</h3>\n<p>Somewhat related to lexical ambiguity is morphological ambiguity, which (as I\nunderstand) is when adding prefixes and suffixes leads to (further) ambiguity.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">This shoe is untieable.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Interpretations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This shoe can be untied.</li>\n<li>This shoe cannot be tied.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With punctuation (different emphasis in speech):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. This shoe is untie-able.\n2. This shoe is un-tieable.</code></pre></div>\n<p>With Esperanto grammar:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. This-shoe-o can-as be-i not-tie-ita.\n2. This-shoe-o not-can-as be-i tie-ita.</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>not- negates</li>\n<li>‘can’ is considered a verb</li>\n<li>-ita means ‘has been done’: ‘tie-ita’ means ‘tied’ as in the adjective\n(note it ends with -a), e.g. tied shoes.</li>\n<li>‘be-i tie-ita’ means ‘to be tied’</li>\n<li>‘can-as be-i tie-ita’ means ‘be able to be tied’</li>\n<li>‘can-as be-i not-tie-ita’ means ‘be able to be not tied’</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The “comma problem”</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">I invited my parents, Jack and Jill to the party.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Interpretations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Two people are invited: my parents who are named Jack and Jill.</li>\n<li>Four people are invited: Jack, Jill and my parents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Changing the sentence structure, and punctuation can disambiguate:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. I invited my parents, Jack, and Jill to the party.\n   I invited Jack, Jill, and my parents to the party.\n\n2. I invited my parents (Jack and Jill) to the party.\n   I invited to the party, my parents: Jack and Jill.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Esperanto grammar (as well as more regular punctuation):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1. I invite-is I-an parent-ojn, Jack-on, and Jill-on to the-party-o.\n2. I invite-is I-an parent-ojn who name-as Jack and Jill to the-party-o.</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>‘I’ becomes ‘my’ by adding -a.</li>\n<li>Since ‘my parents’ is a direct object we also add -n, so ‘I-an parent-ojn’.</li>\n<li>I’m not sure if Jack and Jill need -o’s in the second sentence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The “it problem”</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">The dog furiously chased the cat until it suddenly fell.</code></pre></div>\n<p>What is ‘it’ referring to?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The dog chased the cat until the cat fell.</li>\n<li>The dog chased the cat until the dog fell.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I can’t think of a way to disambiguate this while keeping the ‘it’.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1.
