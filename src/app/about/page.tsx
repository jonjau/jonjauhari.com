        <p>
          I'm a Melbourne-based software engineer interested in financial
          applications, currently developing for an investment platform.

          Recently, I've been exploring full-stack web development, working with
          React on the front end and Spring Boot and Node.js on the server side.
          Of course, I'm looking to gain more practical experience working with
          other technology stacks, mainly so I'll have more to write here...
